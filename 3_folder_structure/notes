2 folders are matter of concern

1. public
    (*)index.html -> starting point of the project, yhi single page load hota hai aur ek he page hota hai, thats why it is call SPA(Single Page Application).

    menifest.json -> configuration setting(meta data) for serving website to mobile device or desktop.

    <noscript> </noscript> tag show warning when java script is not enable in the browser.
2. src
    ->index.js(main.jsx) -> 
    #ReactDOM is implementation of react in web

    -> ReactDO M creates khudka dom(virtual dom) which checks difference in actual dom and make changes according to that. 

    exported function must be in Capital Case.

    only one element can be returned. so wrap it in <> </>
