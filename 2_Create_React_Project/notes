npm vs npx

npm(node package manager) -> for installing dependencies in react

npx (node package executer) -> for executing dependencies without installation.

package.json -> file having project information and dependencies.

main libraries -> react ,react-dom, react-scripts, web-vitals(performance tracking)

scripts-> Run the project.
    start-> run the project
    build -> production time me helpful hai
    test -> testing perpose
    eject -> getting out from the react mtlb itna he kaam hai react se ab dusre pr kaam krunga.
etc.... 

2. Command to run the project.
